2025-11-25 02:02:40,468 - [WARNING] - Reason: The student essay describes personal weekend activities and preferences, such as walking, helping with chores, playing sports, and watching movies. It completely fails to address the prompt's core topic of children's screen time, its causes, or its effects on development. There is no mention of 'children', 'screens', 'reasons', or 'effects on development' in the essay. It is a completely different subject.

The essay reads more like a description of a typical weekend than an essay about a specific hobby.

While it briefly mentions 'Free university education' and 'University', it fails to develop any coherent argument, address the specific question of whether it *should be free for all students*, or state an extent of agreement/disagreement. The few coherent phrases are too general and fragmented to constitute a response to the prompt's specific focus.

2025-11-25 02:34:30,265 - [WARNING] - Reason: The essay contains significant portions of gibberish ('asdfjkl; qweruiop zxcvbnm', 'Hhjkafdhjk afdhsjkl afdhsjkl gfdhjksl', '1234567890 1234567890') which makes it largely unintelligible and irrelevant to the prompt. While it briefly mentions 'Free university education' and 'University', it fails to develop any coherent argument, address the specific question of whether it *should be free for all students*, or state an extent of agreement/disagreement. The few coherent phrases are too general and fragmented to constitute a response to the prompt's specific focus.
