We will ride on the road and then sail on the water!\n\nPenelope: Who thinks of these things?\n\nAnna: I don't know. But I'm glad they do! Let's get aboard, Sailor!\n\nPenelope: (looking at a brochure about the boat) Hey, did you know that this bus … um, boat was created during World War II to carry people and supplies?\n\nAnna: Wow.
