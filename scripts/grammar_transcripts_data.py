Look at these examples to see how adjectives are used with prepositions.

"I'm interested in the idea.

My jacket is similar to yours.

She's brilliant at maths.

My neighbour is angry about the party."

Grammar explanation

Some adjectives go with certain prepositions. There are no grammatical rules for which preposition is used with which adjective, so it's a good idea to try to learn them together. To help you do this, write new vocabulary in your notebook in a sentence or phrase.

However, there are some patterns that can help you. Let's look at them first. Remember that a preposition is followed by a noun or a gerund (-ing form).

With at

We use at with adjectives like good/bad/amazing/brilliant/terrible, etc. to talk about skills and abilities.

"He's really good at English.

She's amazing at the piano.

They're terrible at organising anything.

I'm not very good at drawing."

With about

We often use about with adjectives of feelings like angry/excited/happy/nervous/sad/stressed/worried, etc. to explain what is causing that feeling.

"I'm angry about the decision.

He's nervous about the presentation.

She's excited about the new job.

They were worried about the exam."

With of

However, sometimes we use of with feelings.

"She was afraid of telling her mum.

I'm frightened of having an accident.

He's scared of flying.

You should be proud of your progress."

With to

We can use to to show the connection between people or things.

"He's married to the director.

I'm addicted to my phone.

I'm allergic to nuts.

It's similar to the old one."

We can also use to to talk about someone's behaviour towards someone else.

"They were really friendly to me.

Was he nice to you?

He is always polite to everyone.

She was very rude to the waitress."

Here are some other useful adjectives with prepositions.

With for

"Exercise is good for you.

Stress is bad for you.

The town is famous for its cheese.

I'm responsible for the financial side of the business."

With in

"She's interested in the project.

They want someone who's experienced in design.

I didn't want to get involved in the argument."""

Look at these examples to see how adjectives ending in -ed and -ing are used.

"I was really bored in that presentation.

That was a really boring presentation."

Grammar explanation

Adjectives that end in -ed (e.g. bored, interested) and adjectives that end in -ing (e.g. boring, interesting) are often confused.

-ed adjectives

Adjectives that end in -ed generally describe emotions – they tell us how people feel.

I was so bored in that lesson, I almost fell asleep.

He was surprised to see Helen after all those years.

She was really tired and went to bed early.

-ing adjectives

Adjectives that end in -ing generally describe the thing that causes the emotion – a boring lesson makes you feel bored.

"Have you seen that film? It's really frightening.

I could listen to her for hours. She's so interesting.

I can't sleep! That noise is really annoying!"

Here are some adjectives that can have both an -ed and an -ing form.

annoyed / annoying
bored / boring
confused / confusing
disappointed / disappointing
excited / exciting
frightened / frightening
interested / interesting
surprised / surprising
tired / tiring
worried / worrying"""

"She's a doctor.

I need an umbrella.

Have you heard the news?

I don't like spiders."

Grammar explanation

Here are some of the most important things to know about using articles.

Jobs

When we say what people's jobs are, we usually use a/an.

"He's an architect.

She's a scientist.

My grandmother was a teacher."

Singular nouns

Singular, countable nouns always have an article – a/an or the (or another determiner – my, your, this, that, etc.).

We use a/an – the indefinite article – when we talk about something for the first time, or something that is part of a group or type.

"I saw a good film yesterday.

Do you want a drink?"

We use a when the word that follows it begins with a consonant sound. We use an when it's followed by a vowel sound. This makes pronunciation easier.

"She has a university degree.

It took me an hour to get home."

We use the – the definite article – when the listener already knows which thing we are talking about because it was mentioned before or because there's only one of them.

"I'm going to take the dog for a walk.

Have you seen the car key?

They go to the school next to the bridge."

Things in general

When we talk about things in general, we normally use a plural or uncountable noun with no article.

"Birds eat worms.

Water freezes at 0°C.

Children need a lot of sleep."

Particular groups of things

When we talk about a particular group of things, we use the.

"We went to the zoo and saw the kangaroos." (These are the particular kangaroos in that zoo – not kangaroos in general.)"""

"I'm going to bed.

I walk to work.

My children are going to start school.

I visited the school yesterday.

Mount Everest is in the Himalayas."

Grammar explanation

Here are some ways we use articles in common phrases and place names.

Common phrases

We don't usually use an article in expressions with bed, work and home.

"go to bed / be in bed
go to work / be at work / start work / finish work
go home / be at home / get home / stay at home"

We also don't normally use an article in expressions with school, university, prison and hospital.

"start school / go to school / be at school
go to university / be at university
be sent to prison / go to prison / be in prison
go to hospital / be in hospital"

But we usually use the if someone is just visiting the place, and not there as a student/prisoner/patient, etc.

"My son has started school now. I went to the school to meet his teacher.

I went to the prison a lot when I was a social worker.

I'm at the hospital. My sister has just had a baby."

Place names

We don't normally use an article for continents, most countries, cities, towns, lakes, mountains or universities. So, we say:

"Africa, Asia, Europe
India, Ghana, Peru, Denmark
Addis Ababa, Hanoi, New York, Moscow
Lake Victoria, Lake Superior, Lake Tanganyika
Mount Everest, Mount Kilimanjaro, Mount Elbrus
Cardiff University, Harvard University, Manchester University"

Some countries are different. Country names with United have the. There are other countries which are exceptions too. So, we say:

"the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, the United States of America
the Bahamas, the Gambia"

Seas and oceans, mountain ranges and rivers have the:

"the Atlantic, the Pacific, the Mediterranean
the Andes, the Himalayas, the Alps
the Nile, the Amazon, the Yangtze"

Universities with of in the title also have the:

"the University of Cape Town, the University of Delhi, the University of Tokyo" """

            "title": "Comparative adjectives",
            "content": """Do you know how to use comparative adjectives like older, better and more interesting? Test what you know with interactive exercises and read the explanation to help you.

Look at these examples to see how we use comparative adjectives.

"The city is more interesting than the countryside.

This house is older than my house.

She's better at cooking now than before."

Grammar explanation

We use comparative adjectives to compare two things or show change. The comparative form depends on the number of syllables in the adjective.

Adjectives with one syllable

To make comparative forms with one-syllable adjectives, we usually add -er:

"old → older
clean → cleaner
slow → slower"

If an adjective ends in -e, we add -r:

"safe → safer
nice → nicer"

If an adjective ends in a vowel and a consonant, we usually double the consonant:

"big → bigger
hot → hotter"

Adjectives with two or more syllables

If a two-syllable adjective ends in a consonant and -y, we change -y to -i and add -er:

"noisy → noisier
happy → happier
easy → easier"

We use more to make comparative forms for most other two-syllable adjectives and for all adjectives with three or more syllables:

"crowded → more crowded
stressful → more stressful
dangerous → more dangerous"

Exception: You can either add -er/-r or use more with some two-syllable adjectives, such as common, cruel, gentle, handsome, likely, narrow, pleasant, polite, simple and stupid.

"I think life in the countryside is simpler than in the city.

It's more simple to live in the city because everything you need is there."

Irregular adjectives

The adjectives good, bad and far have irregular comparative forms:

"good → better
bad → worse
far → further/farther"

Than

When we want to say which person or thing we are comparing with, we can use than:

"Their house is cleaner than ours.

Traffic is slower in the city than in the countryside.

After the race I was more tired than Anne." """

"I'm making a cup of tea.

There's some money on the table.

Have we got any bread?

How many chairs do we need?

How much milk have we got?"

Grammar explanation

Nouns can be countable or uncountable. Countable nouns can be counted, e.g. an apple, two apples, three apples, etc. Uncountable nouns cannot be counted, e.g. air, rice, water, etc. When you learn a new noun, you should check if it is countable or uncountable and note how it is used in a sentence.

Countable nouns

For positive sentences we can use a/an for singular nouns or some for plurals.

"There's a man at the door.

I have some friends in New York."

For negatives we can use a/an for singular nouns or any for plurals.

"I don't have a dog.

There aren't any seats."

Uncountable nouns

Here are some examples of uncountable nouns:

bread
rice
coffee
information
money
advice
luggage
furniture

We use some with uncountable nouns in positive sentences and any with negatives.

"There's some milk in the fridge.

There isn't any coffee."

Questions

In questions we use a/an, any or how many with countable nouns.

"Is there an email address to write to?

Are there any chairs?

How many chairs are there?"

And we use any or how much with uncountable nouns.

"Is there any sugar?

How much orange juice is there?"

But when we are offering something or asking for something, we normally use some.

"Do you want some chocolate?

Can we have some more chairs, please?"

We also use some in a question when we think the answer will be 'yes'.

"Have you got some new glasses?"

Other expressions of quantity

A lot of (or lots of) can be used with both countable and uncountable nouns.

"There are lots of apples on the trees.

There is a lot of snow on the road."

Notice that we don't usually use many or much in positive sentences. We use a lot of instead.

"They have a lot of money."

However, in negative sentences we use not many with countable nouns and not much with uncountable nouns.

"There are a lot of carrots but there aren't many potatoes.

There's lots of juice but there isn't much water." """

Look at these examples to see how the past continuous and past simple are used.

"When I woke up this morning, it was snowing.

I was sleeping when you called me."

Grammar explanation

The past continuous and the past simple help us to show how two past actions or situations are connected.

Past simple

The past simple shows us that an action was in the past, not in the present. Regular past simple verbs have -ed at the end (e.g. called, played, arrived). Irregular verbs have a different form, usually with a different vowel sound (e.g. wake → woke, break → broke, feel → felt).

"My parents called me yesterday.

I woke up early this morning.

Sam played basketball when he was at university."

We make the negative with didn't and the infinitive verb.

"My parents didn't call me yesterday.

I didn't wake up early this morning."

We make the question form with did and then the subject and infinitive verb.

"Did you wake up early this morning?

Did Sam play basketball when he was at university?"

Past continuous

The past continuous shows us that the action was already in progress at a certain time in the past.

"What were you doing at 8 p.m. last night? I was studying."

This means that I started studying before 8 p.m. and I continued after 8 p.m.

The past continuous can also show that an activity was in progress for some time, not just for a moment.

"We were cleaning the house all morning."

We make the past continuous with was or were and the -ing form of the verb.

"She couldn't come to the party. She was working.

Three years ago, we were living in my home town.

I tried to give him some advice, but he wasn't listening.

What were you doing this time last year?"

Past continuous and past simple

When we use these two tenses together, it shows us that the past simple action happened in the middle of the past continuous action, while it was in progress.

"While I was studying, I suddenly felt sleepy."

We often use these tenses to show an action interrupting another action.

"I broke my leg when I was skiing.

As I was going to work, I saw an old friend.

We were watching television when the power went off."

Can you see a difference in the meaning of these two sentences?

"When the guests arrived, Jane was cooking dinner.

When the guests arrived, Jane cooked dinner."

In the first one, Jane started cooking dinner before the guests arrived. We know that because it uses the past continuous. In the second sentence, the guests arrived first and then Jane started cooking."""

Look at these examples to see how we use possessive 's.

"Mohammed is my brother's son.

My grandpa's beard is white.

This is my grandparents' house."

Grammar explanation

We can use possessive 's to talk about the relationship between people or to say who owns something. Possessive 's always comes after a noun or a name.

We often use possessive 's or s' when we talk about family and friends.

"Grandma and Grandpa are my mum's parents.

Maria's best friend is Juanita.

My cousins' birthdays are both in January."

We can also use it to say that something belongs to someone.

"That's Roberto's flat. He's got a flat in the city centre.

Kim's hair is very long. She's got long, black hair.

My parents' garden is beautiful. They grow a lot of flowers."

When it is one person who owns something, we usually use 's.

"Our friend's car is red. She loves it.

Simon's phone is new. He bought it yesterday.

Can you see Amira's keys? She can't find them."

It is possible to use more than one possessive in a phrase.

"We had lunch at my friend's father's house.

If a name or noun ends in s, we can add either ' or 's. The pronunciation can be /zɪz/ or /sɪz/.

"Is that James' bag?

That's my boss's office."

If the thing belongs to more than one person, we usually add ' after the s of the plural noun.

"Our friends' house is in the mountains. They moved there last year.

My grandparents' dog is called Bertie.

The twins' school is closed today."

If the plural noun is irregular and doesn't end in s, we add 's.

"This is our children's school.

The women's clothes are on the second floor.

A lot of people's eyes are brown."

If something belongs to more than one person, and we give a list of names, the 's comes after the last name in the list.

"Liam is Anne and Gary's son."

Remember that s at the end of a word without an apostrophe (') can make it plural, but this doesn't show possession.

Look at these examples to see how questions are made.

Is he a teacher?

Does she eat meat?

When did you get here?

How much does a train ticket cost?

Grammar explanation

To make questions, we often put the verb before the subject. This is called inversion.

Affirmative / Question

I am late. / Am I late?

I can help. / Can I help?

She is sleeping. / Is she sleeping?

We have met before. / Have we met before?

If there is a question word (why, what, where, how, etc.), it goes before the verb.

Question / Question with question word

Are you late? / Why are you late?

Was she there? / When was she there?

Can I help? / How can I help?

Have we met before? / Where have we met before?

This is true for sentences with be, sentences that have auxiliary verbs (e.g. They are waiting. She has finished.) and sentences with modal verbs (can, will, should, might, etc.).

Questions in the present simple and past simple

For other verbs in the present simple, we use the auxiliary verb do/does in the question.

Affirmative / Question / Question with question word

You work at home. / Do you work at home? / Where do you work?

It costs £10. / Does it cost £10? / How much does it cost?

We use the auxiliary verb did in the past simple.

Affirmative / Question / Question with question word

She went home. / Did she go home? / Where did she go?

They went to the cinema. / Did they go to the cinema? / Where did they go?

Subject questions

In some questions, who or what is the subject of the verb. There is no inversion of subject and verb in these questions.

We use there is to say that something exists or is in a place.

There is a bridge in the park.

We use there is for singular nouns and there are for plural nouns.

There is a restaurant in the station.

There are two cafés in the shopping centre.

We can say there's instead of there is. We often say this when we speak. But there is no short form for there are.

There is a restaurant in the station. > There's a restaurant in the station.

There are two cafés. > There're two cafés.

When we are speaking informally and make a list of things, we often use there is or there's instead of there are.

There's a café, a supermarket and a bus stop on my street.

(Instead of There are a café, a supermarket and a bus stop on my street.)

Negative

For negatives, we use there isn't or there's not (= there is not) for singular and there aren't (= there are not) for plural. 

There isn't a pharmacy near the hotel.

There aren't any restaurants near the hotel.

We often use there isn't a + singular noun, there isn't any + uncountable noun and there aren't any + plural noun.

There isn't a café near here.

There isn't any milk.

There aren't any toilets in the park.

To show that the negative is important, we also often use there is no + uncountable noun and there are no + plural noun. (It is possible to use there is no + singular noun, but it's not as common.)

There's no milk.

There are no toilets in the park.

Questions

For questions, we say Is there for singular nouns and uncountable nouns and Are there for plural nouns. 

Is there a café near here?

Is there any milk in the fridge?

Are there any toilets in the park?

To answer, we say Yes, there is (not Yes, there's) or No, there isn't, or Yes, there are or No, there aren't.

Grammar explanation

A verb can be followed by another verb. The second one usually needs to change into the -ing form or the to + infinitive form. Which form you need depends on what the first verb is.

Verbs followed by the -ing form

When enjoy, admit and mind are followed by another verb, it must be in the -ing form.

I enjoy travelling.

He admitted stealing the necklace.

I don't mind waiting if you're busy.

Other verbs in this group include avoid, can't help, consider, dislike, feel like, finish, give up, miss, practise and suggest.

Like and love can be followed by the -ing form and the to + infinitive form. They are both correct.

Verbs followed by to + infinitive form

When want, learn and offer are followed by another verb, it must be in the to + infinitive form.

If you freeze water, it becomes solid.

If it rains tomorrow, I'll take the car.

If I lived closer to the cinema, I would go more often.

Grammar explanation

Conditionals describe the result of a certain condition. The if clause tells you the condition (If you study hard) and the main clause tells you the result (you will pass your exams). The order of the clauses does not change the meaning.

If you study hard, you will pass your exams.

You will pass your exams if you study hard.

Conditional sentences are often divided into different types.

Zero conditional

We use the zero conditional to talk about things that are generally true, especially for laws and rules.

If I drink too much coffee, I can't sleep at night.

Ice melts if you heat it.

When the sun goes down, it gets dark.

The structure is: if/when + present simple >> present simple.

First conditional

We use the first conditional when we talk about future situations we believe are real or possible.

If it doesn't rain tomorrow, we'll go to the beach.

Arsenal will be top of the league if they win.

When I finish work, I'll call you.

In first conditional sentences, the structure is usually: if/when + present simple >> will + infinitive. 

It is also common to use this structure with unless, as long as, as soon as or in case instead of if.

I'll leave as soon as the babysitter arrives.

I don't want to stay in London unless I get a well-paid job.

I'll give you a key in case I'm not at home.

You can go to the party, as long as you're back by midnight.

Second conditional

The second conditional is used to imagine present or future situations that are impossible or unlikely in reality.

If we had a garden, we could have a cat.

If I won a lot of money, I'd buy a big house in the country.

I wouldn't worry if I were you.

The structure is usually: if + past simple >> + would + infinitive. 

When if is followed by the verb be, it is grammatically correct to say if I were, if he were, if she were and if it were. However, it is also common to hear these structures with was, especially in the he/she form.

Grammar explanation

Do you know how to use third and mixed conditionals?

Third conditionals and mixed conditionals

Conditionals describe the result of a certain condition. The if clause tells you the condition (If I hadn't been ill) and the main clause tells you the result (I would have gone to the party). The order of the clauses does not change the meaning.

If I hadn't been ill, I would have gone to the party.

I would have gone to the party if I hadn't been ill.

Conditional sentences are often divided into different types.

Third conditional

The third conditional is used to imagine a different past. We imagine a change in a past situation and the different result of that change.

If I had understood the instructions properly, I would have passed the exam.

We wouldn't have got lost if my phone hadn't run out of battery.

In third conditional sentences, the structure is usually: If + past perfect >> would have + past participle.

Mixed conditionals

We can use mixed conditionals when we imagine a past change with a result in the present or a present change with a result in the past.

1. Past/Present 

Here's a sentence imagining how a change in a past situation would have a result in the present.

If I hadn't got the job in Tokyo, I wouldn't be with my current partner.

So the structure is: If + past perfect >> would + infinitive.

2. Present/Past

Here's a sentence imagining how a different situation in the present would mean that the past was different as well.

It's really important. If it wasn't, I wouldn't have called you on your holiday.

And the structure is: If + past simple >> would have + past participle."""

Despite the law, people continue to use mobile phones while driving.

It's illegal to use mobile phones while driving. People still do it, though.

Grammar explanation

Although, even though, in spite of and despite are all used to link two contrasting ideas or show that one fact makes the other fact surprising. They can all be used at the beginning or in the middle of the sentence. 

Despite the rain, we enjoyed the festival.

We enjoyed the festival, despite the rain.

The main difference between although, even though, in spite of and despite is that they are used with different structures. 

in spite of / despite

After in spite of and despite, we use a noun, gerund (-ing form of a verb) or a pronoun.

They never made much money, in spite of their success.

In spite of the pain in his leg, he completed the marathon.

Despite having a headache, I had a great birthday.

The train was cancelled. In spite of that, we arrived on time.

Note that it is common to use in spite of and despite with the expression the fact that, followed by a subject and verb.

Despite the fact that he worked very hard, he didn't pass the exam.

although / even though

Although we saw each other every day, we didn't really know each other.

Even though she spoke very quietly, he understood every word.

Grammar explanation

Used to + infinitive and be/get used to + -ing look similar but they have very different uses.

used to

We use used to + infinitive to talk about a past situation that is no longer true. It tells us that there was a repeated action or state in the past which has now changed.

will

We use will to talk about spontaneous plans decided at the moment of speaking.

Adjectives and adverbs

We can use so with an adjective or adverb to make it stronger.

He walks so slowly. It's so annoying!

If we are using the comparative form of the adjective or adverb, we use so much to make it stronger.

Nouns

With a noun or adjective + noun, we use such to make it stronger.

Permission

can

We often use can to ask for and give permission.

Can I sit here?

You can use my car if you like.

Can I make a suggestion?

could

may

May is the most formal way to ask for and give permission.

Prohibition

We use can't and mustn't to show that something is prohibited – it is not allowed.

can't

We use can't to talk about something that is against the rules, particularly when we didn't make the rules.

What does this sign say? Oh, we can't park here.

You can't take photos in the museum. They're really strict about it.

Sorry, we can't sell knives to under-18s.

must not/mustn't

Visitors must not park in the staff car park.

Baggage must not be left unattended.

Guests must not make noise after 10 p.m.

We use mustn't particularly when the prohibition comes from the speaker.

(Parent to child) You mustn't say things like that to your sister.

(Teacher to student) You mustn't be late to class.

I mustn't let that happen again.

Obligation

We use have to and must to express obligation. There is a slight difference between the way we use them.

have to

Have to shows us that the obligation comes from outside the speaker. 

We have to wear a uniform when we're working in reception.

(Student to teacher) When do we have to hand in our homework?

Al has to work tomorrow so he can't come.

We sometimes call this 'external obligation'.

must

Must expresses a strong obligation or necessity. It often shows us that the obligation comes from the speaker (or the authority that wrote the sentence). 

I must phone my dad. It's his birthday today.

(Teacher to student) You must hand in your homework on Tuesday or you will lose ten per cent of your mark.

(Sign on a plane) Seat belts must be worn by all passengers.

Note that we don't use must to express obligation in the past. We use have to instead.

I had to pay £85 to renew my passport last week.

No obligation

don't have to

We use don't have to to show that there is no obligation. You can do something if you want to but it's not compulsory.

He's much shorter than his brother.

Good-quality socks are almost as important as your running shoes.

Our hotel room was exactly the same as the photos showed.

Grammar explanation

There are several different ways to compare things in English. We can also modify comparisons to show big or small differences.

Comparing

We can use comparative adjectives to compare different things.

Max is taller than Judy.

You're more patient than I am.

His first book is less interesting than his second.

We can use as … as with an adjective to say that two things are the same, or not as … as to say that one thing is less than another. 

Her hair is as long as mine.

It's not as sunny as yesterday.

We can also use expressions like different from, similar to and the same as.

England is different from the United Kingdom.

His car is similar to mine.

The results from the first test are the same as the results from the second.

Showing big differences

We can use much, so much, a lot, even or far with comparative adjectives.

Sales in July were a lot higher than sales in June.

He was far less experienced than the other applicant.

We can use nowhere near with as … as.

The interview was nowhere near as difficult as the written exam.

We can use very, really, completely or totally with different from.

They may be twins, but they're completely different from each other.

Showing small differences

We can use slightly, a little, a bit, a little bit or not much with comparative adjectives.

The number of registrations has been slightly lower than we expected.

Houses in my city are not much more expensive than flats.

We can use almost, nearly, not quite, roughly, more or less or about with as … as and the same as.

She's almost as old as I am.

The figures for May are more or less the same as the figures for June.

We can use very or really with similar to.

My son looks really similar to my father when he was that age.

Showing there is no difference

We can use exactly the same as or just as … as to emphasise that there is no difference.

My grandma's cakes still taste exactly the same as when I was a child!

A new phone can be just as expensive as a new computer these days."""

A lot of olive oil is produced in Italy.

The suspect will be released tomorrow.

This product has not been tested on animals.

Grammar explanation

We use the passive voice to change the focus of the sentence.

My bike was stolen. (passive – focus on my bike)

Someone stole my bike. (active – focus on someone)

We often use the passive:

when we prefer not to mention who or what does the action (for example, it's not known, it's obvious or we don't want to say)

so that we can start a sentence with the most important or most logical information

in more formal or scientific writing.

How we make the passive

We make the passive using the verb be + past participle. We start the sentence with the object.

Avatar was directed by James Cameron.

↓ ↓ ↓

Object + be + past participle

It is not always necessary to add who or what did the action.

My flight is cancelled.

Object + be + past participle

Only the form of be changes to make the tense. The past participle stays the same. Here are examples of the passive in its most common tenses.

Present simple: Alioli is made from oil, garlic and salt. / is/are + past participle

Present continuous: The hall is being painted this week. / is/are being + past participle

General ability

We usually use could or couldn't to talk about general abilities in the past.

She could paint before she started school.

I couldn't cook until I went to university.

When I lived next to the pool, I could go swimming every day.

Ability on one occasion – successful

When we talk about achieving something on a specific occasion in the past, we use was/were able to (= had the ability to) and managed to (= succeeded in doing something difficult).

The burglar was able to get in through the bathroom window.

The burglar managed to get in through the bathroom window even though it was locked.

Could is not usually correct when we're talking about ability at a specific moment in the past.

We would always go to the seaside for our holidays.

But one holiday we went to the mountains instead.

Grammar explanation

When we talk about things in the past that are not true any more, we can do it in different ways.

Used to + infinitive

We can use used to to talk about past states that are not true any more.

We used to live in New York when I was a kid.

There didn't use to be a supermarket there. When did it open?

Did you use to have a garden?

We can also use used to to talk about past habits (repeated past actions) that don't happen any more.

I used to go swimming every Thursday when I was at school.

She used to smoke but she gave up a few years ago.

used to + infinitive should not be confused with be/get used to + -ing, which has a different meaning. The difference is covered here.

Would

We can use would to talk about repeated past actions that don't happen any more.

Every Saturday I would go on a long bike ride.

My dad would read me amazing stories every night at bedtime.

would for past habits is slightly more formal than used to. It is often used in stories. We don't normally use the negative or question form of would for past habits. Note that we can't usually use would to talk about past states. 

Past simple

We can always use the past simple as an alternative to used to or would to talk about past states or habits. The main difference is that the past simple doesn't emphasise the repeated or continuous nature of the action or situation. Also, the past simple doesn't make it so clear that the thing is no longer true.

We went to the same beach every summer.

We used to go to the same beach every summer.

We would go to the same beach every summer.

If something happened only once, we must use the past simple.

Time up to a point in the past

We use the past perfect simple (had + past participle) to talk about time up to a certain point in the past.

She'd published her first poem by the time she was eight. 

We'd finished all the water before we were halfway up the mountain.

Had the parcel arrived when you called yesterday?

Past perfect for the earlier of two past actions

We can use the past perfect to show the order of two past events. The past perfect shows the earlier action and the past simple shows the later action.

When the police arrived, the thief had escaped.

It doesn't matter in which order we say the two events. The following sentence has the same meaning.

The thief had escaped when the police arrived.

Note that if there's only a single event, we don't use the past perfect, even if it happened a long time ago.

The Romans spoke Latin. (NOT The Romans had spoken Latin.)

Past perfect after before

We can also use before + past perfect to show that an action was not done or was incomplete when the past simple action happened.

They left before I'd spoken to them.

Sadly, the author died before he'd finished the series.

Adverbs

We often use the adverbs already (= 'before the specified time'), still (= as previously), just (= 'a very short time before the specified time'), ever (= 'at any time before the specified time') or never (= 'at no time before the specified time') with the past perfect. 

I called his office but he'd already left.

This is the form. Please can you fill it in?

Why are you bringing that argument up now?

Police are looking into connections between the two crimes.

We need to come up with a solution.

Grammar explanation

Phrasal verbs are very common in English, especially in more informal contexts. They are made up of a verb and a particle or, sometimes, two particles. The particle often changes the meaning of the verb.

I called Jen to see how she was. (call = to telephone)

They've called off the meeting. (call off = to cancel)

In terms of word order, there are two main types of phrasal verb: separable and inseparable. 

Separable

With separable phrasal verbs, the verb and particle can be apart or together.

They've called the meeting off.

OR

They've called off the meeting.

However, separable phrasal verbs must be separated when you use a personal pronoun. 

The meeting? They've called it off.

Here are some common separable phrasal verbs:

I didn't want to bring the situation up at the meeting.

(bring up = start talking about a particular subject)

Please can you fill this form in?

(fill in = write information in a form or document)

I'll pick you up from the station at 8 p.m.

(pick up = collect someone in a car or other vehicle to take them somewhere)

She turned the job down because she didn't want to move to Glasgow.

(turn down = to not accept an offer)

Non-separable

Some phrasal verbs cannot be separated. 

Who looks after the baby when you're at work?

Even when there is a personal pronoun, the verb and particle remain together.

Who looks after her when you're at work?

Here are some common non-separable phrasal verbs:

I came across your email when I was clearing my inbox. 

(come across = to find something by chance)

The caterpillar turned into a beautiful butterfly. 

(turn into = become)

It was quite a major operation. It took months to get over it and feel normal again. 

(get over = recover from something)

We are aware of the problem and we are looking into it. 

(look into = investigate)

Some multi-word verbs are inseparable simply because they don't take an object.

I get up at 7 a.m.

With two particles

Phrasal verbs with two particles are also inseparable. Even if you use a personal pronoun, you put it after the particles.

Who came up with that idea? 

(come up with = think of an idea or plan)

Let's get rid of these old magazines to make more space. 

(get rid of = remove or become free of something that you don't want)

I didn't really get on with my stepbrother when I was a teenager.

(get on with = like and be friendly towards someone)

Can you hear that noise all the time? I don't know how you put up with it. 

(put up with = tolerate something difficult or annoying)

The concert's on Friday. I'm really looking forward to it.

Grammar explanation

Capitalisation

There are lots of times when you need to use capital letters – for example, to start a sentence or for the pronoun I. Here are some other important rules for using them.

Days, months and holidays

We capitalise days of the week, months and festivals, but not seasons.

His birthday party is on Thursday.

Schools are closed at Christmas.

It rains a lot in April and May, but the summer is very dry.

Names of people and places

We capitalise the names of people and places, including streets, planets, continents and countries.

Bea Jankowski has lived on Church Street in Manchester for 20 years.

The Earth is the third planet from the Sun.

Russia is in both Europe and Asia.

Words that come from the names of places – for example languages, nationalities and adjectives that refer to people or things from a country, region or city – are capitalised. We also capitalise nouns and adjectives that come from the names of religions.

Some Canadians speak French.

Londoners eat a lot of Indian food.

Most Muslims fast during the day for Ramadan.

Titles and names of institutions

The names of organisations and usually the important words in book and film titles are capitalised. When a person's job title goes before their name, capitalise both. If the title is separate from their name, capitalise only their name.

Salome Zourabichvili, the president of Georgia, is visiting President Alvi tomorrow.

The chief executive officer lives in New York.

We are reading War and Peace with Ms Ioana, our teacher.

Apostrophes

We use an apostrophe to show a contraction or possession.

Contractions

We use an apostrophe to show where there are missing letters in contractions.

It's raining. (It's = It is)

Don't worry, it won't rain. (Don't = Do not; won't = will not)

She can't drive because she's broken her leg. (can't = cannot; she's = she has)

I'd like a coffee, please. (I'd = I would)

You'll be fine. (You'll = You will)

** Note that it's is a contraction of it is or it has. its is a possessive form of the pronoun it.

The dog is chasing its tail.

Are you sure it's OK for me to ring you so early?

It's rained a lot this week.

Possession

We also use an apostrophe with the letter s after a noun (normally a person, animal or group) to show that the noun owns someone or something.

My cat's favourite toy is a small, red ball.

Sadiq's parents live in Liverpool.

South Korea's economy is growing. 

Singular or plural

We use 's when the possessor is singular.

Marie's mother is going to Hong Kong.

We also use 's when the possessor is a plural noun that does not end in s.

The People's Republic of China

My cousin writes children's books.

When a plural noun ends in s, we put the apostrophe after the s (s').

This is a picture of my parents' house.

Our friend's new car is red. She just got it yesterday.

Our friends' new car is red. They just got it yesterday.

This exercise is really difficult.

This exercise is completely impossible.

Grammar explanation

Gradable adjectives

Most adjectives are gradable. This means we can have different levels of that quality. For example, you can be a bit cold, very cold or extremely cold. We can make them weaker or stronger with modifiers:

She was quite angry when she found out.

The film we saw last night was really funny!

It can be extremely cold in Russia in the winter.

Here is a list of some common gradable adjectives and some modifiers that we can use with them.

Modifiers: a little/a bit → pretty/quite → really/very → extremely

Adjectives: angry, big, boring, cheap, cold, expensive, frightening, funny, hot, interesting, old, pretty, small, tasty, tired, etc.

Non-gradable: absolute adjectives

Some adjectives are non-gradable. For example, something can't be a bit finished or very finished. You can't be a bit dead or very dead. These adjectives describe absolute qualities. To make them stronger we have to use modifiers like absolutely, totally or completely:

Thank you, I love it! It's absolutely perfect!

Their farm was totally destroyed by a tornado.

My work is completely finished. Now I can relax.

Here is a list of some common absolute adjectives and some modifiers that we can use with them.

Modifiers: absolutely/totally/completely

Adjectives: acceptable, dead, destroyed, finished, free, impossible, necessary, perfect, ruined, unacceptable, etc.

Non-gradable: extreme adjectives

Adjectives like amazing, awful and boiling are also non-gradable. They already contain the idea of 'very' in their definitions. If we want to make extreme adjectives stronger, we have to use absolutely or really:

Did you see the final match? It was absolutely amazing!

After 32 hours of travelling, they were absolutely exhausted.

My trip home was really awful. First, traffic was really bad, then the car broke down and we had to walk home in the rain.

Here is a list of some common extreme adjectives and some modifiers that we can use with them.

Modifiers: absolutely/really

Adjectives: amazing, ancient, awful, boiling, delicious, enormous, excellent, exhausted, fascinating, freezing, gorgeous, terrible, terrifying, tiny, etc."""

I haven't seen her today.

My phone's run out of battery. Can I use yours?

Have you ever dyed your hair a different colour?"

Grammar explanation

We use the present perfect simple (have or has + past participle) to talk about past actions or states which are still connected to the present.

Unfinished time and states

We often use the present perfect to say what we've done in an unfinished time period, such as today, this week, this year, etc., and with expressions such as so far, until now, before, etc.

"They've been on holiday twice this year.

We haven't had a lot of positive feedback so far.

I'm sure I've seen that film before."

We also use it to talk about life experiences, as our life is also an unfinished time period. We often use never in negative sentences and ever in questions.

"I've worked for six different companies.

He's never won a gold medal.

Have you ever been to Australia?"

We also use the present perfect to talk about unfinished states, especially with for, since and how long.

"She's wanted to be a police officer since she was a child.

I haven't known him for very long.

How long have you had that phone?"

Finished time and states

If we say when something happened, or we feel that that part of our life is finished, we use the past simple.

"We visited Russia for the first time in 1992.

I went to three different primary schools.

Before she retired, she worked in several different countries."

We also use the past simple for finished states.

"We knew all our neighbours when we were children.

I didn't like bananas for a really long time. Now I love them!"

Past actions with a result in the present

We can use the present perfect to talk about a past action that has a result in the present.

"He's broken his leg so he can't go on holiday.

There's been an accident on the main road, so let's take a different route.

They haven't called me, so I don't think they need me today."

Again, if we say when it happened, we use the past simple.

"He broke his leg last week so he can't go on holiday."

However, we often use the present perfect with words like just, recently, already, yet and still.

"We've recently started going to the gym.

She's already finished season one and now she's watching season two.

They've been waiting for hours.

Grammar explanation

We use both the present perfect simple (have or has + past participle) and the present perfect continuous (have or has + been + -ing form) to talk about past actions or states which are still connected to the present.

Focusing on result or activity

The present perfect simple usually focuses on the result of the activity in some way, and the present perfect continuous usually focuses on the activity itself in some way. 

Present perfect simple: Focuses on the result / Says 'how many' / Describes a completed action

Present perfect continuous: Focuses on the activity / Says 'how long' / Describes an activity which may continue

You've cleaned the bathroom! It looks lovely!

I've been gardening. It's so nice out there.

She's read ten books this summer.

She's been reading that book all day.

I've written you an email. 

I've been writing emails.

When we can see evidence of recent activity

The grass looks wet. Has it been raining?

I know, I'm really red. I've been running!

Ongoing states and actions

We often use for, since and how long with the present perfect simple to talk about ongoing states.

How long have you known each other?

We've known each other since we were at school. 

We often use for, since and how long with the present perfect continuous to talk about ongoing single or repeated actions.

How long have they been playing tennis?

They've been playing tennis for an hour.

They've been playing tennis every Sunday for years.

Sometimes the present perfect continuous can emphasise that a situation is temporary.

Grammar explanation

We often use just, yet, still and already with the present perfect because they are related to the present moment. This page focuses on the meaning and use of these words when they are used with the present perfect.

just

Just used with the present perfect means 'a short time before'.

I've just seen Susan coming out of the cinema.

Mike's just called. Can you ring him back, please?

Have you just taken my pen?!

Just comes between the auxiliary verb (have/has) and the past participle.

yet

Yet used with the present perfect means 'at any time up to now'. We use it to emphasise that we expect something to happen soon. Yet (in this context) is only used in negative sentences and questions.

Have you finished your homework yet?

I haven't finished it yet. I'll do it after dinner.

A. Where's Sam? B: He hasn't arrived yet.

Yet comes at the end of the sentence or question.

still

Still used with the present perfect means that something hasn't happened. We use it to emphasise that we expected the thing to happen earlier. Still (in this context) is only used in negative sentences.

I've been waiting for an hour and the bus still hasn't come.

They promised me that report yesterday but they still haven't finished it.

She still hasn't replied to my email. Maybe she's on holiday.

Still comes between the subject (the bus, they, etc.) and auxiliary verb (haven't/hasn't).

already

Already used with the present perfect means 'before now'. We use it to emphasise that something happened before something else or earlier than expected.

I've already spent my salary and it's two weeks before payday.

He wanted to see Sudden Risk but I've already seen it.

The train's left already!

Already can come between the auxiliary and the main verb or at the end of the clause."""

Look at these examples to see how question tags are used.

You haven't seen this film, have you?

Your sister lives in Spain, doesn't she?

He can't drive, can he?

Grammar explanation

We can add question tags like isn't it?, can you? or didn't they? to a statement to make it into a question. Question tags are more common in speaking than writing.

We often use question tags when we expect the listener to agree with our statement. In this case, when the statement is positive, we use a negative question tag.

She's a doctor, isn't she?

Yesterday was so much fun, wasn't it?

If the statement is negative, we use a positive question tag. 

He isn't here, is he?

The trains are never on time, are they?

Nobody has called for me, have they?

If we are sure or almost sure that the listener will confirm that our statement is correct, we say the question tag with a falling intonation. If we are a bit less sure, we say the question tag with a rising intonation.

Formation

If there is an auxiliary verb in the statement, we use it to form the question tag.

I don't need to finish this today, do I?

James is working on that, isn't he?

Your parents have retired, haven't they?

The phone didn't ring, did it?

It was raining that day, wasn't it?

Your mum hadn't met him before, had she?

Sometimes there is no auxiliary verb already in the statement. For example, when:

... the verb in the statement is present simple or past simple and is positive. Here we use don't, doesn't or didn't:

Jenni eats cheese, doesn't she?

I said that already, didn't I? 

... the verb in the statement is to be in the present simple or past simple. In this case we use to be to make the question tag:

The bus stop's over there, isn't it?

None of those customers were happy, were they?

... the verb in the statement is a modal verb. Here we use the modal verb to make the question tag:

They could hear me, couldn't they?

You won't tell anyone, will you?

If the main verb or auxiliary verb in the statement is am, the positive question tag is am I? but the negative question tag is usually aren't I?:

I'm never on time, am I?

I'm going to get an email with the details, aren't I?"""

Reflexive pronouns are words like myself, yourself, himself, herself, itself, ourselves, yourselves and themselves. They refer back to a person or thing.

We often use reflexive pronouns when the subject and the object of a verb are the same. 

I cut myself when I was making dinner last night.

I hope you enjoy yourselves at the party tonight!

My phone isn't working properly. It turns itself off for no reason.

We need to believe in ourselves more.

Adding emphasis

We can add a reflexive pronoun for emphasis when it's unusual or different.

He wants to pass his driving test so that he can drive himself to work.

She broke her arm, so she couldn't wash herself very easily.

We can use reflexive pronouns to emphasise that someone does it personally, not anybody else.

The door was definitely locked. I locked it myself.

Are you redecorating your flat yourselves?

We can also use a reflexive pronoun together with the noun it refers to in order to emphasise it.

We talked to the manager herself, and she agreed to give us our money back.

Parents themselves need to take more responsibility for their children's learning.

By + reflexive pronoun

We can use by + reflexive pronoun to mean alone.

He usually goes on holiday by himself.

Do you enjoy being by yourself?

Reciprocal pronouns

Notice the difference between plural reflexive pronouns and reciprocal pronouns (each other, one another).

They're buying themselves a new television.

They're buying each other small gifts.

We looked at ourselves in the mirror.

We looked at each other in surprise.

With reciprocal pronouns (e.g. each other), each person does the action to the other person/people but not to themselves."""

Are you the one who sent me the email?

The phone which has the most features is also the most expensive.

This is the video that I wanted to show you.

The person they spoke to was really helpful.

Grammar explanation

Relative clauses give us information about the person or thing mentioned. 

Defining relative clauses give us essential information – information that tells us who or what we are talking about.

The woman who lives next door works in a bank. 

These are the flights that have been cancelled.

We usually use a relative pronoun or adverb to start a defining relative clause: who, which, that, when, where or whose.

who/that

We can use who or that to talk about people. that is more common and a bit more informal.

She's the woman who cuts my hair.

He's the man that I met at the conference.

which/that 

We can use which or that to talk about things. that is more common and a bit more informal.

There was a one-year guarantee which came with the TV.

The laptop that I bought last week has started making a strange noise!

Other pronouns

when can refer to a time.

Summer is the season when I'm happiest.

where can refer to a place.

That's the stadium where Real Madrid play.

whose refers to the person that something belongs to.

He's a musician whose albums have sold millions. 

Omitting the relative pronoun

Sometimes we can leave out the relative pronoun. For example, we can usually leave out who, which or that if it is followed by a subject.

The assistant [that] we met was really kind.

   (we = subject, can omit that)

We can't usually leave it out if it is followed by a verb.

The assistant that helped us was really kind.

   (helped = verb, can't omit that)"""

Jack, who's retired now, spends a lot of time with his grandchildren.

We want to see the new Tom Carter film, which was released on Friday.

My sister, whose dog I'm looking after, is visiting a friend in Australia.

Grammar explanation

Relative clauses give us information about the person or thing mentioned.

Non-defining relative clauses give us extra information about someone or something. It isn't essential for understanding who or what we are talking about.

My grandfather, who's 87, goes swimming every day.

The house, which was built in 1883, has just been opened to the public.

The award was given to Sara, whose short story impressed the judges. 

We always use a relative pronoun or adverb to start a non-defining relative clause: who, which, whose, when or where (but not that). We also use commas to separate the clause from the rest of the sentence.

who, which and whose

We can use who to talk about people, which to talk about things and whose to refer to the person or thing that something belongs to.

Yesterday I met my new boss, who was very nice.

The house, which is very big, is also very cold!

My next-door neighbour, whose children go to school with ours, has just bought a new car.

After the port there is a row of fishermen's houses, whose lights can be seen from across the bay.

Places and times

We can use which with a preposition to talk about places and times. In these cases it's more common to use where or when instead of which and the preposition.

City Park, which we used to go to, has been closed down.

City Park, where we used to go, has been closed down.

December, which Christmas is celebrated in, is a summer month for the southern hemisphere.

December, when Christmas is celebrated, is a summer month for the southern hemisphere.

However, when we use which without a preposition, we can't use where or when.

Centre Park, which we love, is always really busy on Saturdays.

February, which is my favourite month, lasts 29 days this year."""

indirect speech: He said he'd worked as a waiter before becoming a chef.

direct speech: 'I'll phone you tomorrow,' he said.

indirect speech: He said he'd phone me the next day.

Grammar explanation

Reported speech is when we tell someone what another person said. To do this, we can use direct speech or indirect speech.

direct speech: 'I work in a bank,' said Daniel.

indirect speech: Daniel said that he worked in a bank.

In indirect speech, we often use a tense which is 'further back' in the past (e.g. worked) than the tense originally used (e.g. work). This is called 'backshift'. We also may need to change other words that were used, for example pronouns.

Present simple, present continuous and present perfect

When we backshift, present simple changes to past simple, present continuous changes to past continuous and present perfect changes to past perfect.

'I travel a lot in my job.' 

Jamila said that she travelled a lot in her job.

'The baby's sleeping!' 

He told me the baby was sleeping.

'I've hurt my leg.' 

She said she'd hurt her leg.

Past simple and past continuous

When we backshift, past simple usually changes to past perfect simple, and past continuous usually changes to past perfect continuous.

'We lived in China for five years.' 

She told me they'd lived in China for five years.

'It was raining all day.' 

He told me it had been raining all day.

Past perfect

The past perfect doesn't change.

'I'd tried everything without success, but this new medicine is great.' 

He said he'd tried everything without success, but the new medicine was great.

No backshift

If what the speaker has said is still true or relevant, it's not always necessary to change the tense. This might happen when the speaker has used a present tense.

'I go to the gym next to your house.' 

Jenny told me that she goes to the gym next to my house. I'm thinking about going with her.

'I'm working in Italy for the next six months.' 

He told me he's working in Italy for the next six months. Maybe I should visit him!

'I've broken my arm!' 

She said she's broken her arm, so she won't be at work this week.

Pronouns, demonstratives and adverbs of time and place

Pronouns also usually change in indirect speech.

'I enjoy working in my garden,' said Bob. 

Bob said that he enjoyed working in his garden.

'We played tennis for our school,' said Alina. 

Alina told me they'd played tennis for their school.

However, if you are the person or one of the people who spoke, then the pronouns don't change.

'I'm working on my thesis,' I said. 

I told her that I was working on my thesis.

'We want our jobs back!' we said. 

We said that we wanted our jobs back.

We also change demonstratives and adverbs of time and place if they are no longer accurate.

'This is my house.'

He said this was his house. [You are currently in front of the house.]

He said that was his house. [You are not currently in front of the house.]

'We like it here.'

She told me they like it here. [You are currently in the place they like.]

She told me they like it there. [You are not in the place they like.]

'I'm planning to do it today.'

She told me she's planning to do it today. [It is currently still the same day.]

She told me she was planning to do it that day. [It is not the same day any more.]

direct speech: 'Who did you see?' she asked.

indirect speech: She asked me who I'd seen.

direct speech: 'Could you write that down for me?' she asked.

indirect speech: She asked me to write it down.

Grammar explanation

A reported question is when we tell someone what another person asked. To do this, we can use direct speech or indirect speech.

direct speech: 'Do you like working in sales?' he asked.

indirect speech: He asked me if I liked working in sales.

In indirect speech, we change the question structure (e.g. Do you like) to a statement structure (e.g. I like).

We also often make changes to the tenses and other words in the same way as for reported statements (e.g. have done → had done, today → that day). You can learn about these changes on the Reported speech 1 – statements page.

Yes/no questions

In yes/no questions, we use if or whether to report the question. If is more common.

'Are you going to the Helsinki conference?'

He asked me if I was going to the Helsinki conference.

'Have you finished the project yet?' 

She asked us whether we'd finished the project yet.

Questions with a question word

In what, where, why, who, when or how questions, we use the question word to report the question.

'What time does the train leave?' 

He asked me what time the train left.

'Where did he go?' 

She asked where he went.

Reporting verbs

The most common reporting verb for questions is ask, but we can also use verbs like enquire, want to know or wonder.

'Did you bring your passports?'

She wanted to know if they'd brought their passports.

'When could you get this done by?' 

He wondered when we could get it done by.

Offers, requests and suggestions

If the question is making an offer, request or suggestion, we can use a specific verb pattern instead, for example offer + infinitive, ask + infinitive or suggest + ing.

'Would you like me to help you?' 

He offered to help me.

'Can you hold this for me, please?' 

She asked me to hold it.

'Why don't we check with Joel?' 

She suggested checking with Joel."""

indirect speech: He denied finishing the coffee.

Grammar explanation

When we tell someone what another person said, we often use the verbs say, tell or ask. These are called 'reporting verbs'. However, we can also use other reporting verbs. Many reporting verbs can be followed by another verb in either an infinitive or an -ing form. 

Reporting verb + infinitive

Verbs like advise, agree, challenge, claim, decide, demand, encourage, invite, offer, persuade, promise, refuse and remind can follow an infinitive pattern.

'Let's see. I'll have the risotto, please.'

He decided to have the risotto.

'I'll do the report by Friday, for sure.'

She promised to do the report by Friday.

'It's not a good idea to write your passwords down.'

They advised us not to write our passwords down.

We can also use an infinitive to report imperatives, with a reporting verb like tell, order, instruct, direct or warn.

'Please wait for me in reception.'

The guide told us to wait for her in reception.

'Don't go in there!'

The police officer warned us not to go in there.

Reporting verb + -ing form

Verbs like admit, apologise for, complain about, deny, insist on, mention and suggest can follow an -ing form pattern.

'I broke the window.'

She admitted breaking the window.

'I'm really sorry I didn't get back to you sooner.'

He apologised for not getting back to me sooner.

'Let's take a break.'

She suggested taking a break."""

Look at these examples to see how stative verbs are used.

I think that's a good idea.

I love this song!

That coffee smells good.

Do you have a pen?

Grammar explanation

Stative verbs describe a state rather than an action. They aren't usually used in the present continuous form.

I don't know the answer. I'm not knowing the answer.

She really likes you. She's really liking you.

He seems happy at the moment. He's seeming happy at the moment.

Stative verbs often relate to:

thoughts and opinions: agree, believe, doubt, guess, imagine, know, mean, recognise, remember, suspect, think, understand

feelings and emotions: dislike, hate, like, love, prefer, want, wish

senses and perceptions: appear, be, feel, hear, look, see, seem, smell, taste

possession and measurement: belong, have, measure, own, possess, weigh.

Verbs that are sometimes stative

A number of verbs can refer to states or actions, depending on the context.

I think it's a good idea.

Wait a moment! I'm thinking.

The first sentence expresses an opinion. It is a mental state, so we use present simple. In the second example the speaker is actively processing thoughts about something. It is an action in progress, so we use present continuous.

Some other examples are:

have

I have an old car. (state – possession)

I'm having a quick break. (action – having a break is an activity)

see

Do you see any problems with that? (state – opinion)

We're seeing Tadanari tomorrow afternoon. (action – we're meeting him)

be

He's so interesting! (state – his permanent quality)

He's being very unhelpful. (action – he is temporarily behaving this way)

taste

This coffee tastes delicious. (state – our perception of the coffee)

Look! The chef is tasting the soup. (action – tasting the soup is an activity)

Other verbs like this include: agree, appear, doubt, feel, guess, hear, imagine, look, measure, remember, smell, weigh, wish."""

She's likely to say yes if you ask nicely.

It probably won't rain later according to the weather forecast.

Grammar explanation

We can show how certain we are about the future by using modal verbs and other expressions.

Modal verbs and adverbs

We can use modal verbs (such as will, might, may or could) and adverbs (such as probably and definitely) to show how sure we are.

Very sure

People will definitely work from home more in the future.

Robots definitely won't replace all human jobs.

Sure

Donna will really enjoy this film.

You won't regret it.

Almost sure

We'll probably finish the project by tomorrow.

He probably won't have enough time.

Not sure

I might go to the party, but I'm not sure yet.

He hasn't studied much, so he might not pass the exam.

When you are not sure, we can also use may, could and may not. However, we don't usually use could not to talk about the future.

Other expressions

We can also use other expressions such as be bound to and be likely to, or verbs such as think and doubt.

Very sure

He's bound to feel nervous before his driving test.

She's certain to get that job!

He's certain that he'll get here on time.

There's no chance that we'll ever win the lottery.

Try to do something relaxing, like reading a book or having a bath.

Grammar explanation

as and like are often confused since they can both be used for comparisons. There are, however, important differences.

Making comparisons

as + adjective + as and as much as

We often use the structure as + adjective + as or as much as to say if something has, or doesn't have, the same amount of that quality as something else. 

She loves curry as much as I do.

He's not as tall as his brother.

It's not as expensive as the other hotel.

That dog is as big as that child!

You also have to use as in the expression the same as.

Your phone is the same as mine.

Texting is not the same as speaking in person.

like + noun

In the following comparisons, like is followed by a noun or a pronoun to say that two things are similar.

He's like a father to me.

She's acting like a child.

It's like a burger but with big mushrooms instead of bread.

There are lots of people like us.

It is also common to make comparisons using like with verbs of the senses.

She looks like her mother.

It sounds like a cat.

Nothing tastes like homemade lemonade.

It smells like medicine.

It feels like cotton.

as if/as though + clause

As if and as though can be used to compare a real situation to an imaginary situation. They are followed by a clause (a subject and verb).

You look as if you've seen a ghost.

I felt as if I was floating above the ground.

You talk as though we're never going to see each other again.

Giving examples

We can say like or such as to give examples. 

You could try a team sport like football, basketball or hockey.

You should take something soft, such as a towel, to lie on.

Talking about a job or function

We can use as + noun to talk about a job or function. 

I worked as a shop assistant for two years.

He used his coat as a blanket to keep warm.

as to connect two phrases

as can be used as a conjunction to connect two phrases. It can have different meanings.

as = 'because'

As the road was closed, I had to park on the next street.

as = 'while' or 'during the time that'

I don't read enough.

Is there enough coffee for everyone?

We've had enough of their lies.

Grammar explanation

enough means 'as much as necessary'. It can be used with an adjective, an adverb, a verb or a noun. It can also act as a pronoun.

With adjectives and adverbs

enough comes after adjectives and adverbs.

I'm not tall enough to reach the top shelf.

Your marks are good enough to study engineering at university.

I couldn't write quickly enough and I ran out of time.

I've helped at conferences often enough to know what can go wrong.

With verbs

enough comes after verbs.

I make sure I drink enough during the day.

I don't read enough but I'm going to start downloading books to my phone. 

With nouns

enough comes before nouns.

There isn't enough bread to make sandwiches.

Have you got enough money?

As a pronoun

enough can also be used without a noun. 

I'll get some more chairs. There aren't enough.

A: Do you want more coffee? B: No, I've had enough, thanks.

We know what the noun is because of the context.

With an adjective and a noun

When enough is used with an adjective and a noun, two positions are possible but the meaning changes.

We haven't got big enough envelopes. 

We haven't got enough big envelopes.

When enough is after the adjective (big enough envelopes), it describes the adjective – the envelopes are too small. When enough is before the adjective (enough big envelopes), it describes the noun phrase – we have some big envelopes, but we need more.

enough of

We normally only use enough of when it is followed by a determiner or a pronoun (a/an/the, this/that, my/your/his, you/them, etc.).

There isn't enough of that bread to make sandwiches for everyone.

I've seen enough of his work to be able to recommend him.

Some verbs have a different meaning depending on whether they are followed by an -ing form or to + infinitive. 

stop

Stop + -ing means the action is not happening any more.

I've stopped buying the newspaper because now I read the news online.

Stop + to + infinitive means that someone or something stops an activity so that they can do something else.

He stopped the video to ask the students some questions.

try

Try + -ing means that you are trying something as an experiment, especially as a possible solution to a problem, to see if it works or not.

Have you tried turning the computer off and on again?

Try + to + infinitive means that something is difficult but you are making an effort to do it.

remember/forget

Remember + -ing and forget + -ing refer to having (or not having) a memory of something in the past.

I remember watching this film before.

Grammar explanation

Basic contrasts

We use the present simple to talk about:

something that is always or generally true

When you heat ice, it melts.

something that happens regularly

I go swimming twice a week.

continuing states.

She's very happy with her job.

We use the present continuous to talk about: 

actions which are in progress at the moment

He's busy. He's giving a presentation to some clients.  

temporary actions

I'm working from home this month.

something generally in progress but not actually happening at the moment

More and more people are feeling the effects of climate change.

future plans that have already been organised.

I'm going to Ghana next month. I booked my flights yesterday.

State verbs

State verbs describe a state rather than an action. They aren't usually used in continuous forms, so we use present simple instead of present continuous.

I don't know the answer. I'm not knowing the answer.

He really likes his new house. He's really liking his new house.

They seem busy at the moment. They're seeming busy at the moment.

State verbs often relate to:

thoughts and opinions: agree, believe, doubt, guess, imagine, know, mean, recognise, remember, suspect, think, understand

feelings and emotions: dislike, hate, like, love, prefer, want, wish

senses and perceptions: appear, be, feel, hear, look, see, seem, smell, taste

possession and measurement: belong, have, measure, own, possess, weigh.

Some verbs have a stative meaning and a different active meaning. 

I have a new computer. (state – possession)

I'm having a quick break. (action – having a break is an activity)

This coffee tastes delicious. (state – our perception of the coffee)

Look! The chef is tasting the soup. (action – tasting the soup is an activity)

Other uses of present continuous

verbs describing change and development

Life is becoming more expensive.

complaints and annoying habits

He's always coming in late and making noise. 

Other uses of present simple

headlines

In headings at the top of articles in newspapers and magazines, references to the past are usually simplified to present simple.

Billionaire buys multinational company

instructions

Open the link and enter your password.

Plot summaries

Note that when describing the story of a book, film, play, etc., we use present tenses.

She quits her job and goes in search of adventure. 

While she is travelling in India, she meets someone special.

Anecdotes

People also sometimes use present tenses to tell an anecdote – a funny or interesting story about a real incident. This makes the story more immediate and dynamic.

So I'm on the bus and this guy comes up to me and starts talking to me about someone called Dev. I'm like, 'Sorry, do we know each other?'"""

Grammar explanation

We commonly use words like it, this/these, that/those, such and do so, as well as synonyms, to avoid repetition. This can make a text shorter, easier to understand and more interesting.

It, this and that in texts

It, this/these and that/those can all be used to refer to something that has just been mentioned or that has been mentioned previously.

It is used to refer to something we are already talking or writing about, with no particular emphasis.

We watched the latest episode last night. It was OK, but not nearly as good as the previous ones.

This (or these) is more emphatic and often shows that something is new or interesting. This often signals that more is about to be said about the topic.

More funding has been approved for primary schools in the area. This does not, however, solve the problem faced by …

That (or those) is also more emphatic than it and is used in a similar way to this. However, that suggests greater distance. For example, we can use that to distance ourselves from a particular idea:

They're idiots! … OK, sorry, maybe that was unfair. 

A: I refuse to do this any more!

B: I understand you're upset, but I think that's going a bit too far. 

Or that/those can refer to an idea mentioned further back in the text:

A classic mistake inexperienced hikers make is to pack things they don't really need. Such items can include shoes, extra toiletries and electronics.

(two paragraphs later)Those extra kilos of weight are soon left behind as hikers learn to reduce what they carry to a minimum.

That/those is also chosen over this/these to suggest greater physical distance:

Scientists believe that some animals may use the Earth's magnetic fields to find their way from A to B, even if that B is thousands of miles away.

That and those meaning 'the one(s)'

In more formal English, that and those can be used to mean 'the one' or 'the ones'. They are often followed by of and are used in this way to avoid repetition.

We compared our experience to that of a group of teenagers. (that = the experience)

They obtained better exam results than those of the same year group in other schools.

(those = the exam results)

Those who means 'the people who'.

She was among those who voted for the policy.

Those who are unable to attend the event in person are invited to view it online.

Such meaning 'of this or that type'

In more formal English, such can be used to refer back to the type previously mentioned. 

Some species of ants can find their way using the memory of how many steps they have taken. 

Such navigation methods are actually fairly basic compared with others in the animal world. (such navigation methods = methods of that type)

We can use such in this way before a/an + single noun or before a plural or uncountable noun. It is often used after expressions like no, the only, the few, the first, etc.

The library is free and open to the public 24 hours a day. It is the only such library in the city.

The group will meet once a month to report on progress. The first such meeting will be held in April. 

Do so

Again, in more formal English, do so can be used to mean 'to behave in the way mentioned'. It is used to avoid repeating the verb.

Our company raised salaries, but few others in the sector did so.

Employees who have agreed to work overtime should be prepared to do so this month.

While some went vegan for the supposed health benefits, others reported doing so for ethical reasons.

Synonyms

A synonym is a word or phrase that has the same meaning as another word or phrase. We can use synonyms to avoid repetition.

Air pollution is a significant problem in many European capitals. Urgent action needs to be taken on this worrying issue.

Using synonyms can also make your writing more interesting and enjoyable.

Much as I'd love a holiday this year, I just can't afford it. 

Grammar explanation

Although, despite, even if, even though, in spite of, much as, though, whereas and while are all used to link two contrasting ideas or show that one fact makes the other fact surprising. 

They can all be used at the beginning or in the middle of the sentence. 

In spite of the heavy rain, the hikers continued climbing the mountain.

The hikers continued climbing the mountain in spite of the heavy rain.

The main difference between these conjunctions is that they are followed by different structures. 

In spite of and despite

After in spite of and despite, we use a noun phrase or -ing form of a verb.

We arrived on time in spite of missing the train.

Their restaurant succeeded despite the bad reviews.

It's common to use in spite of and despite with the expression the fact that, so that it can be followed by a subject and verb.

We arrived on time, in spite of the fact that we missed the train.

Their restaurant succeeded, despite the fact that they received bad reviews.

Although, though and even though

After although, though and even though, we use a subject and a verb. They mean the same thing, but even though is slightly stronger and more emphatic than although and though.

Although Marjorie lost the election, many more people voted for her than the first time.

I love my Italian conversation class, though I struggled at first.

Even though my team lost, it was great to be in the stadium for the final.

Though can also go at the end of the second phrase. This way of expressing contrasting ideas is most common in spoken English.

I didn't know anyone when I first got to uni. I soon made friends, though.

Even if

Even if means 'whether or not' or 'no matter whether'. It's followed by a subject and a verb.

Even if you are an expert swimmer, you should be careful at this beach.

While and whereas

While is a conjunction that is most commonly used with time, but it can also be used to mean 'despite the fact that' or 'although'. 

While I made some mistakes in my driving exam, I still passed.

In this sense, while comes at the beginning of the sentence.

While and whereas can be used to mean 'but' or 'compared with the fact that', to compare two contradictory ideas. 

While/Whereas Ivan is very sociable, his brother is more reserved.

My trip home was quick and easy, whereas/while my colleagues were delayed for hours.

In this sense, while/whereas can come at the beginning of the sentence or between the two contradictory clauses.

Much as

Much as is a more formal expression. It means 'although', 'despite how much' or 'no matter how much'.

What he loves about hiking is that it doesn't feel like exercise.

Not only did she sing at the talent show, she also danced!

I know it may surprise you, but I really do know quite a bit about this.

Grammar explanation

We can use different grammatical structures to add emphasis, either to a whole sentence or to highlight one particular part of it.

Cleft sentences

Cleft sentences allow us to emphasise different parts of the sentence, depending on which part is the most important. Cleft sentences are usually introduced by it or by a clause beginning with what.

Cleft sentences beginning with it

Here is a simple sentence with no particular emphasis.

You invited me to the party yesterday.

We can emphasise different elements of this sentence by 'fronting' them, that is, moving them to the front of the sentence after it + be.

It was you who invited me to the party yesterday.

Emphasis: you (not another person)

It was yesterday that you invited me to the party.

Emphasis: yesterday (not another time)

It was the party that you invited me to yesterday.

Emphasis: the party (not another event)

Cleft sentences beginning with what

What clauses + be are common in spoken English. They emphasise the part of the sentence that is outside the what clause.

What I like best about going to the cinema is talking about the film afterwards.

What drives me up the wall is people talking during the film. 

What I found was that the films my friends liked were very different from the ones I liked.

This kind of cleft sentence can also begin with where, why, who, how, etc.

How the kids did this is still unclear to me. 

We can also put the what clause at the end of the sentence.

The game we played was what I liked the most.

Inversion with negative adverbials

We can also use inversion to add emphasis. It has a more formal, persuasive and impressive effect.

To invert a sentence, we put the adverbial (e.g. never, rarely, not only, etc.) at the beginning and change the normal position of the subject and the auxiliary verb.

Rarely have I read such an original story.

(I have rarely read such an original story.)

If there is no auxiliary verb, we need to add one.

Not only do they have live reptiles but you can also touch them.

(They not only have live reptiles but you can also touch them.)

Little, no sooner and not

Some other negative words and expressions used like this are little, no sooner, never and not.

Little did I realise that the restaurant was about to close. 

(I didn't realise that the restaurant was about to close.)

No sooner had we got inside than the concert ended!

Not a single positive comment did I hear from Will.

Emphatic auxiliaries

In spoken English, we often stress the auxiliary verb to add emphasis.

A: Why aren't you coming to my birthday party?

B: I am coming! Who told you I'm not?!

If there is no auxiliary verb, we can use do, does or did to add emphasis. This works in both spoken and written English.

A: I know you weren't keen on the exhibition.

B: I did like some of it. (You thought I didn't like it.)

A: Maybe that's why she was so happy.

B: That does make sense, actually. (I hadn't understood why before.)

In British English, do can also be used this way to make a command more emphatic. This sounds quite formal.

Do sit down, please.

Do be quiet!"""

        {
            "title": "Inversion after negative adverbials",
            "content": """Do you know how to use inversion after negative adverbials like Not only, Barely and Only? Test what you know with interactive exercises and read the explanation to help you.

Look at these examples to see how we use inversion after negative adverbials.

Never have I been so happy to see someone.

Not only did he win the match but he came back from a difficult start.

Barely had she got back in bed when her alarm went off.

Grammar explanation

'Inversion' means reversing (inverting) the normal subject–verb word order in a sentence.

We can use inversion to add emphasis, especially in formal English. It is common, for example, in political speeches, because it has a persuasive and impressive effect.

To invert a sentence in this way, we put the adverbial (e.g. never, rarely, not only, etc.) at the beginning and change the normal position of the subject and the auxiliary verb.

Not only did they arrive late but they talked throughout the film. 

(They not only arrived late but they talked throughout the film.)

If there is no auxiliary verb, we need to add one. For example, we add do for present simple verbs and did for past simple verbs.

Rarely do we find such talent. 

(We rarely find such talent.)

Never, rarely, seldom

These adverbials are often used with present perfect, past perfect or modals like can and could. 

Never had they seen so many people in the village.

Seldom has she taken a day off work.

Rarely can a patient fully recover from such an injury.

Hardly, barely, scarcely, no sooner

These adverbials often refer to an event which quickly follows another in the past and are usually used with past perfect. Hardly, scarcely and barely are followed by when in the contrasting clause, and no sooner is followed by than.

Hardly had we sat down when we were told to evacuate the building.

Scarcely had the votes been counted when the new president was pushed in front of TV cameras.

No sooner had the game started than the captain was taken ill.

No sooner was the new park open than it started raining. 

Only + time expression

These include only after, only if/when, only then and only later.

Only when they refilled my glass did I realise it was broken.

Only later did they discover they hadn't been told the truth.

Phrases with no and not

These include under no circumstances, on no account, at no time, in no way, on no condition, not until and not only.

Under no circumstances should children travel without an adult.

In no way did we agree to this.

Little

In these sentences, little has a negative or restrictive meaning.

Little do people realise how hard it is to be a chef.

(People don't realise how hard it is to be a chef.)

Little did she know then that she would become the company director.  

(She didn't know then that she would become the company director.)"""

Certainty

must

We use must when we feel sure that something is true or think it's the only realistic possibility.

You must be tired. You've been travelling all day.

That must be Clare's house. I can see her car outside.

Note that we use must to show that we deduced this – we have arrived at this conclusion by reasoning.  

This must be her house. (I've arrived at this conclusion by reasoning or looking at the evidence.)

This is her house. (A simple statement of fact.)

be bound to

We can also use be bound to to express certainty about a guess or prediction.

There are transport strikes tomorrow, so travel is bound to be more difficult.

They are by far the best team – they're bound to win.

Be bound to is not a modal verb, but it is a related expression.

can't

We use can't when we feel sure that something is not possible.

That can't be right, can it?

It can't be easy for him, looking after three kids on his own.

Degrees of uncertainty

should/shouldn't

We use should and shouldn't to show expectations about the future. They show we think something will probably be the case because it's normal or reasonable to expect. 

Rest and drink plenty of water. You should feel better in a day or two.

It shouldn't be a problem.

Should and shouldn't in this context have the meaning of 'if all goes well'. We don't use them to predict something negative or unwanted. 

The treatment should be very painful.

Our flight shouldn't arrive on time.

might, may, could

We use might, may or could to say that we think something in the present or future is possible but we're not sure. 

I might see you tomorrow if you're in the office.

There may be another issue that we don't know about.

This illness could be prevented.

They all have the same meaning, but may is more formal than might and could.

Adding well after the modal makes the situation sound more likely.

I'll try the pharmacy, but it might well be closed now.

Looked after carefully, these boots will last for many years.

Not wanting to hurt his feelings, I avoided the question. 

Having lived through difficult times together, they were very close friends.

Grammar explanation

Participle clauses enable us to say information in a more economical way. They are formed using present participles (going, reading, seeing, walking, etc.), past participles (gone, read, seen, walked, etc.) or perfect participles (having gone, having read, having seen, having walked, etc.). 

We can use participle clauses when the participle and the verb in the main clause have the same subject. For example,

Waiting for Ellie, I made some tea. (While I was waiting for Ellie, I made some tea.)

Participle clauses do not have a specific tense. The tense is indicated by the verb in the main clause. 

Participle clauses are mainly used in written texts, particularly in a literary, academic or journalistic style. 

Present participle clauses

Here are some common ways we use present participle clauses. Note that present participles have a similar meaning to active verbs. 

To give the result of an action

The bomb exploded, destroying the building.

To give the reason for an action

Knowing she loved reading, Richard bought her a book.

To talk about an action that happened at the same time as another action

Standing in the queue, I realised I didn't have any money.

To add information about the subject of the main clause

Starting in the new year, the new policy bans cars in the city centre.

Past participle clauses

Here are some common ways that we use past participle clauses. Note that past participles normally have a passive meaning.

With a similar meaning to an if condition

Used in this way, participles can make your writing more concise. (If you use participles in this way, … )

To give the reason for an action

Worried by the news, she called the hospital.

To add information about the subject of the main clause

Filled with pride, he walked towards the stage.

Perfect participle clauses

Perfect participle clauses show that the action they describe was finished before the action in the main clause. Perfect participles can be structured to make an active or passive meaning.

Having got dressed, he slowly went downstairs.

Having finished their training, they will be fully qualified doctors.

Having been made redundant, she started looking for a new job.

Participle clauses after conjunctions and prepositions

It is also common for participle clauses, especially with -ing, to follow conjunctions and prepositions such as before, after, instead of, on, since, when, while and in spite of.

Before cooking, you should wash your hands. 

Instead of complaining about it, they should try doing something positive.

Look at these examples to see how we use reporting verbs.

Harper reminds us that human rights are the priority.

Smith suggests introducing small changes at first.

Brown warns governments not to ignore ordinary people.

Grammar explanation

When we tell someone what another person said, we often use the reporting verbs say, tell and ask. However, we can also use other verbs to more accurately report what the speaker has said. 

Each reporting verb requires a different pattern after it, and more than one pattern is possible after some verbs.

Verb + infinitive

When some verbs are immediately followed by another verb, the second verb is in infinitive form.

They refuse to accept responsibility for the accident.

He promised not to share our personal information.

Verbs in this group include agree, claim, demand, offer, promise, refuse and threaten.

Verb + object + infinitive

Some verbs that are followed by the infinitive need an object between the reporting verb and the infinitive. 

The judge ordered the police to release the individual immediately.

Ferguson warns governments not to delay any further.

Verbs in this group include advise, ask, encourage, invite, order, remind, tell, urge and warn.

Verb + -ing 

When certain verbs are immediately followed by another verb, the second verb has to be in -ing form. 

She recommends waiting for the refund.

Computer scientists admit not knowing where the faulty data came from.

Verbs in this group include admit, deny, mention, recommend and suggest. 

Verb + preposition + -ing 

Note that when verbs with dependent prepositions are followed by another verb, we always use the -ing form. 

Employees complain about receiving important information too late.

Two organisations apologised for not being present.

Verbs in this group include apologise for, complain about, confess to, insist on and object to. 

This structure is also used with warn when it is followed by the preposition against, and admit when it is followed by the preposition to.

Novak warns against moving too fast.

They'll never admit to not knowing the answer.

Verb + object + preposition + -ing

Some verbs that are followed by the -ing form need an object between the reporting verb and the preposition.

O'Reilly accused the government of lying about the issue.

Parents blame schools for not doing enough to tackle bullying.

Verbs in this group include accuse (someone of), blame (someone for), and congratulate (someone on).

Verb + that + subjunctive

Some reporting verbs can also be followed by that + the base form of the verb. The verb in this part of the sentence is in the subjunctive and has no tense.

We suggest that she read the documents carefully before signing.

Steiner demanded that the government investigate the issue.

Reporting verbs can be followed by the subjunctive when they express something that is wanted. These verbs include advise, ask, command, demand, insist, order, propose, recommend, request, suggest and urge.

Verb + that + indicative

When reporting verbs do not relate to a desire, they can be followed by a that clause in a variety of tenses, and the subjunctive is not necessary.

Customers complained that they had not been kept informed.

Experts admit that it will take a long time to develop a solution.

Sengupta agrees that we need a better system.

Verbs in this group include admit, advise, agree, claim, complain, decide, deny, explain, insist, promise, recommend and say.

Verb + object + that clause

With verbs like assure, persuade, remind, tell and warn, we put the object after the reporting verb and before the that clause.

a film night (NOT a film's night)

the winter months (NOT the winter's months)

We often use the passive:

so that we can start a sentence with the most important or most logical information
when we prefer not to mention who or what does the action (for example, it's not known, it's obvious or we don't want to say)
in more formal or scientific writing.

Be + past participle

The most common way to form the passive is subject + be + past participle. 

"The new smoke alarm was installed yesterday."

The 'doer' of the action is called the agent. Most of the time, the agent is not mentioned, but if important, the agent can be mentioned using the preposition by.

"The new smoke alarm was installed yesterday by the company director herself."

We can also use the passive voice with modal verbs such as can, must and should, by using modal + be + past participle.

"A podcast can be made with minimal resources. 

The accident must be reported to the police.

New laws should be created to regulate electric scooters."

The passive with get

In informal English, get is sometimes used instead of be to form the passive.

"My bicycle got stolen last night.

(= My bicycle was stolen last night.)"

The impersonal passive

The impersonal passive is used with reporting verbs such as allege, believe, claim, consider, estimate, expect, know, report, say, think, understand, etc. It reports what an unspecified group of people say or believe.

The impersonal passive has two forms:

it + be + past participle + (that) + subject + verb:

"It is estimated that millions of people visit the site every year.

It is believed that the walls date from the third century BCE.

It is reported that mosquitoes transmit the disease."

someone/something + be + past participle + infinitive:

"Millions of people are estimated to visit the site every year.

The walls are believed to date from the third century BCE.

Mosquitoes are reported to transmit the disease."

Note that the infinitive can be simple (as above), perfect (for a past action) or continuous (for an action in progress).

"Millions are estimated to visit the site this year. (simple infinitive)

The walls are believed to have been built in the third century BCE. (perfect infinitive)

Mosquitoes are reported to be transmitting the disease. (continuous infinitive)" """
