  "fullTranscript": "At America's 149th Westminster Kennel Club dog show, Monty the giant schnauzer won the top prize.\n\nThe lively schnauzer beat six other finalists in New York City to become the first of his breed to win Westminster's \"best in show.\" The prize is the most important and respected in the U.S. dog show world.\n\nWhile Monty came close to winning Westminster the past two years, he fell short of the big prize. In December 2024, the dog won another big prize, the huge American Kennel Club championship.\n\nBut for dog show lovers, Westminster is considered the Super Bowl of all shows. This year the comparison is especially fitting. That is because the most respected U.S. dog competition opened on the same weekend as the Super Bowl -- the most important game in American professional football. This rare happening came after the dates of both competitions changed in recent years.\n\nAt Westminster, dogs first compete against other members of their breed. Then, the winner of each breed goes up against other dogs within different competition \"groups.\" Among the groups are sporting, working, toy, and herding. Group winners then compete in the final round.\n\nThe best in show winner gets an award – a large, shiny cup called a trophy – and a place in dog-world history. The top prize, however, does not include money.\n\nIn her report on the dog show, Learning English's Caty Weaver explains that the Westminster show dates back to 1877. It centers on the traditional purebred judging that leads to the best in show prize. But over the last few years, the organization has added agility and obedience events open to mixed-breed dogs.\n\nIn 2024, Sage, a miniature poodle, won best in show at the 148th Westminster Kennel Club dog show.\n\nAnd in 2023, a petit basset griffon Vendéen, named Buddy Holly, won best in show at Westminster. The breed he represents is known for its rabbit-hunting abilities.\n\nI'm Anna Matteo.",
